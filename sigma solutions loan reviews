A traditional payday loan — or cash advance loan — is a short term loan that’s designed to act as a bridge between paydays. They offer small loan amounts and require full repayment when you receive your next paycheck.

Payday loans can be a good way to get a little extra cash that you can repay when you receive your next paycheck — but they often come at a very high cost. The average payday lender charges upward of 400% interest. That usually equates to approximately $15 in finance fees for every $100 you borrow.

And if you can’t repay the debt within a 14- to 30-day window, your loan provider will roll the debt over into a new loan with added fees. Payday loan rollovers have left some consumers paying as much as $50,000 in interest charges on a $2,500 loan. That’s why several states have limited the number of loan rollovers allowed, and some states have banned payday loans completely.
