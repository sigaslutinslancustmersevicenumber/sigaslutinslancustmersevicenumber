Most cash advance lenders don’t require a credit check for approval. Instead, these lenders want to see that you have enough income to repay your loan.

You can prove your income by showing recent paycheck stubs that give insight into your weekly or biweekly earnings. Most payday lenders require borrowers to be employed to qualify for a loan. The lender will base your loan offer on your earnings, but the maximum amount you can borrow varies by state.

A longer-term installment loan will require a credit check for approval, but the lenders that partner with the networks we recommend have very forgiving approval standards. These lenders will often approve a loan application from any borrower who has bad credit as long as they can prove they have sufficient income to repay the loan.

The best way to find out whether you’ll qualify for a personal loan from an online lending network is to submit a loan request to the network of your choice. This won’t result in a hard inquiry on your credit report that can harm your credit score. If you qualify, you could receive multiple loan offers to choose from.
